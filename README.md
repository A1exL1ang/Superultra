## Overview
Superultra is a UCI compliant chess engine that uses an alpha-beta search framework, various heuristics and optimization techniques, and an efficiently updatable neural network (NNUE) in order to analyze chess positions and calculate moves.

## Usage
Superultra supports the UCI Protocol but does not come with a GUI (like most UCI chess engines). It is recomended to download a UCI Compatable GUI such as cutechess.

## Building
```
cd src
make
```

## Features

### Board Representation
* Bitboards
* Magic Bitboards for efficient slider attack generation

## More About the NNUE
The Neural Network is trained by a <a href="https://github.com/A1exL1ang/NNUE-Trainer/tree/main">C++ trainer</a> that I wrote myself. It is important to note that the training data I used is generated by external engines due to a lack of hardware resources. Specifically, I used data from the <a href="https://lczero.org/blog/2021/04/jumping-on-the-nnue-bandwagon">lc-fish project</a>.
